How to run:
To run the program, enter the command:
node compiler.js [filename]

The program will produce an output file called compiled.js.

Pipeline Structure:
The main program is run in compiler.js.

File is Read -> Split into line by line -> lines are passed into AST ->
Ast is used to buffer -> buffer is written to compiled file

Limitations:
There are several simplifications in this project.
Statements need to be fit in one line:
e.g:
print("Hello world")
x = 10

instead of

print(
"Hello World"
) # Don't do this
x =
10 # Don't do this
